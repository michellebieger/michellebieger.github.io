								<b>Education:</b> My master's degree was earned from the University of Hertfordshire in 2018: an upper-second class MPhy with honours. My favourite modules in University were those that involved the most coursework and coding. 
								Particular highlights included: Rocket Performance and Propulsion, which thoroughly enthralled my inner six-year old who’d grown up visiting both the NASA centres in Houston and Florida numerous times; Programming and Statistics, where I learned how to more thoroughly parse through data and its meanings; and High Energy Astrophysics, where I was finally formally exposed to astrophysics.
								I received my dual high school diploma from St. Paul American School Beijing in 2014, where I earned an American diploma with a 3.75 GPA (of a 4.0 scale) as well as an equivalent Chinese diploma.

								<b>Teaching:</b>
								I currently demonstrate in a year-two Natural Sciences laboratory course at the University of Exeter.  
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b>
								I began doing outreach in my third year of university, bolstered by the experienced I'd gained in high school teaching English in a Chinese kindergarten on school afternoons and volunteering for my local library in Florida.
								The outreach I did at the Univeristy of Hertfordshire included organising students and staff for public evenings at Bayfordbury, and leading planetarium presentations at schools and at general public events (in both small and large planetariums, and what was, at the time, the largest inflatable planetarium in the UK!). 
								
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Equity & Inclusion:</b> 
								I applied for, and was selected by lecturers to be, 'SSRO' at Hertfordshire–a role wherein I represented my School and course representatives to the Student’s Union. As SSRO, I represented a wide variety of student opinions, and worked to create change in our School’s curriculum in order to promote student’s learning and well-being. I was a member of the Equality Committee and presented regularly at department meetings, including a presentation to the Vice-Chancellor and his office and Juno meetings. I met with student representatives regularly, encouraging them to address issues with lecturers and advising them on how best to tackle any course concerns, using insight from my own past two years of being student representative to do so.

I believe it was both my work as Chair of my University's physics society and SSRO that led to my nomination of Vice Chancellor’s Student of the Year for PAM by the staff at PAM.
