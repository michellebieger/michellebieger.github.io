								<b>Education:</b> My master's degree was earned from the University of Hertfordshire in 2018: an upper-second class MPhy with honours. My favourite modules in University were those that involved the most coursework and coding. 
								Particular highlights included: Rocket Performance and Propulsion, which thoroughly enthralled my inner six-year old who’d grown up visiting both the NASA centres in Houston and Florida numerous times; Programming and Statistics, where I learned how to more thoroughly parse through data and its meanings; and High Energy Astrophysics, where I was finally formally exposed to astrophysics.
								
								<br>I received my dual high school diploma from St. Paul American School Beijing in 2014, where I earned an American diploma with a 3.75 GPA (of a 4.0 scale) as well as an equivalent Chinese diploma. I had previously attended high school in Texas and Florida.

								<b>Research Interests:</b> exoplanet atmospheres and their characterisation, machine-learning, early-Earth conditions and habitability of exoplanets, climate crisis

								<br> As a first-year PhD, I put together a literature review, the keywords for which summarise my research interests broadly: Bayesian analysis, specifically MCMC; radiative transfer; forward modelling; retrievals. The completion of my PhD is expected to be at the latest summer 2023. 
								<br><b>ARES Summer School:</b>
								<br>I began my PhD by attending the ARIEL Retrieval of Exoplanets School in October 2019. During this summer school, I was introduced to the Iraclis python package and Tau-REx code, developed by UCL's Angelos Tsiaris and Ingo Waldmann. The school introduced me to the European exoplanet community, as well as allowed me to gain experience in the data reducation of Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 spectrum of transiting exoplanets and characterise their atmospheres with the Tau-REx 2 retrieval method.

								<b>Teaching:</b>
								I currently demonstrate in a year-two Natural Sciences laboratory course (NSC2001) at the University of Exeter. This entails helping students prepare and understand experiments, working with them through the experiments including troubleshooting on the day of, and grading reports and presentations from students. After demonstrating from 2019-2022, helping to adapt the course to online learnign during the pandemic and then transitioning back again, I am lead demonstrator for the 2022-2023 academic year, formalising my role in the past where I have helped interface between module leaders and fellow demonstrators and lab technicians.  
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b>
								I began doing outreach in my third year of university, bolstered by the experienced I'd gained in high school teaching English in a Chinese kindergarten on school afternoons and volunteering for my local library in Florida.
								The outreach I did at the Univeristy of Hertfordshire included organising students and staff for public evenings at Bayfordbury, and leading planetarium presentations at schools and at general public events (in both small and large planetariums, and what was, at the time, the largest inflatable planetarium in the UK!). 
								I continue doing outreach during my PhD as a letter writer for Letters to a Pre-Scientist, which encourages young students in the United States to learn more about STEM careers.
								Additionally, I do climate crisis work such as engaging in climate justice workshops, completing verified courses on climate crisis topics, and additional outreach efforts on climate crisis. For more information, please contact me for my CV for details on this.
								
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Equity & Inclusion:</b> 
								I applied for, and was selected by lecturers to be, 'SSRO' at Hertfordshire–a role wherein I represented my School and course representatives to the Student’s Union. As SSRO, I represented a wide variety of student opinions, and worked to create change in our School’s curriculum in order to promote student’s learning and well-being. I was a member of the Equality Committee and presented regularly at department meetings, including a presentation to the Vice-Chancellor and his office and Juno meetings. I met with student representatives regularly, encouraging them to address issues with lecturers and advising them on how best to tackle any course concerns, using insight from my own past two years of being student representative to do so.

It was both my work as Chair of my University's physics society and SSRO that led to my nomination of Vice Chancellor’s Student of the Year for PAM by the staff at PAM, amongst other University awards, as well as being chosen to be the <a href="https://youtu.be/blUugGGGHn4?t=4568">student speaker for my graduation in September 2018</a>.
